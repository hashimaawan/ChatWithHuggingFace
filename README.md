Chat Interface

This is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to interact with Hugging Face models for various tasks such as image generation, text classification, summarization, and translation. The application is powered by the Hugging Face `transformers` and `diffusers` libraries, and uses the Stable Diffusion model for image generation.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Generate an image based on a user-provided prompt using Stable Diffusion.
- **Text Classification**: Classify text into categories.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarize a given piece of text.
- **Text Translation**: Translate text from English to French.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Hugging Face Token**: You will need a Hugging Face API token to access the models. You can get one by creating an account and generating a token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-with-hugging-face.git
   cd chat-with-hugging-face



### Steps to complete:

1. **Update placeholders**: Replace `your_hugging_face_token` and the repository URL (`your-username/chat-with-hugging-face`) with the actual values.
2. **Add screenshots**: Take screenshots of your running app (for example, showing the interface with generated images, text classification, etc.) and save them in a folder named `screenshots`. Update the image paths accordingly in the `README.md`.
