Chat Interface

This is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to interact with Hugging Face models for various tasks such as image generation, text classification, summarization, and translation. The application is powered by the Hugging Face `transformers` and `diffusers` libraries, and uses the Stable Diffusion model for image generation.

- **Text Translation**: Translate text from English to French.
